    This is my digital landscape adapation of Waves at Matsushima
    <br /> painted by Tawaraya Sotatsu. This being one of my favorite paintings,
    <br /> the process of recreating it in a medium that I feel strips it
    <br /> of its expressive quality, was hard. However, I feel that the piece
    <br /> I made is also expressive, but has lost the original's feeling of longing
    <br /> and isolation.
